# Udacity Project1
This is a project aimed at analysing the datasets provided by Airbnb activity in Seattle, WA, USA. The project employs the use of the CRISP-DM process and explores three separate datasets.

These datasets describe the listing activity of homestays in Seattle since 2008, guests and hosts .

###### Content
The following three Airbnb datasets are included:

Listings, including full descriptions and average review score
Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day

###### Inspiration
Can you describe the vibe of each Seattle neighborhood using listing descriptions?
What are the busiest times of the year to visit Seattle? By how much do prices spike?
Is there a general upward trend of both new Airbnb listings and total Airbnb visitors to Seattle?
