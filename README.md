# Udacity Project1
This is a project aimed at analysing the datasets provided by Airbnb on its activity in Seattle, WA, USA. The project employs the use of the CRISP-DM process and explores three separate datasets.

Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day

## Installations:

## Questions
