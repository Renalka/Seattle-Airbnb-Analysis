# Udacity Project1
This is a project aimed at analysing the datasets provided by Airbnb on its activity in Seattle, WA, USA. The project employs the use of the CRISP-DM process and explores three separate datasets.

These datasets describe the listing activity of homestays in Seattle since 2008.

## Content
The following three Airbnb datasets are included:

Listings, including full descriptions and average review score
Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day

## Installations:
This project requires Python 3.x and the following Python libraries installed:
Numpy
Pandas
Matplotlib

## Questions 
1. Which months have the most Airbnb listings?
2. Which months fetch the highest prices?
3. What is the total revenue that can be generated each month?
4. Which neighbourhoods are the most expensive and the cheapest?
5. How much time do the hosts take in responding?
6. Which are the top ten neighbourhoods in terms of number of listings?
7. What are the main types of properties available?
8. Which factors affect ratings and prices the most?

## Linear Regression
We have also attempted to predict prices using Linear Regression.
The R2 score came out to be 40%.

## Results:
The results and analyses are included in the jupyter notebook. A detailed explanation of the results is posted on Medium.

Some conclusions are as follows :
